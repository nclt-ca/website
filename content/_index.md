## Transforming the old Jam Factory Building into a space for Nelson's Creatives

Nelson, BC is a haven for artists—woodworkers, potters, painters, and makers of all kinds. Yet our creative community lacks dedicated public workspace.

The Jam Factory Building offers 25,000 square feet of heritage character, ready to become a vibrant, community-owned studio and co-working space where creators and artists can work, collaborate, and thrive together.

NCLT is a non-profit community land trust. Membership is open to anyone living in the local area. The organization is accountable to its membership, putting the building into community ownership.
