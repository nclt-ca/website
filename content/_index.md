title: "A space for Nelson's creatives"

Nelson, BC is a haven for artists—woodworkers, potters, painters, and makers of all kinds. Yet our creative community lacks dedicated public workspace.

Let's organize to create one together.

The Jam Factory Building offers 25,000 square feet of heritage character, ready to become a vibrant, community-owned studio and co-working space where creators and artists can work, collaborate, and thrive.

Our goal is to bring this building into community ownership.
